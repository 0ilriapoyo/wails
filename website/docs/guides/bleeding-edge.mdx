# Bleeding Edge

## Overview

Wails is in constant development and new releases are regularly "tagged". This usually happens when all the newer code
on `master` has been tested and confirmed working. If you need a bugfix or feature that has not yet made it to a release,
it's possible to use the latest "bleeding edge" version using the following steps:

- `git clone https://github.com/wailsapp/wails`
- `cd wails/v2/cmd/wails`
- `go install`

NOTE: The directory that you cloned the project into will now be called "<clonedir>".

The Wails CLI will now be at the very latest version. To update projects to use the latest version, update the project's
`go.mod` and ensure the following line is at the bottom of the file:

`replace github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2 v2.0.0-beta.20 => <clonedir>`

Example:

On Windows:
`replace github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2 v2.0.0-beta.20 => C:\Users\leaan\Documents\wails-v2-beta\wails\v2`

On 'nix:
`replace github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2 v2.0.0-beta.20 => /home/me/projects/wails/v2`

To revert back to a stable version, run:

`go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@latest`
