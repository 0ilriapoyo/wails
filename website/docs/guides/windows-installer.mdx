# Building NSIS installer

Wails supports generating Windows installers using the [NSIS installer](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/).

## Installing NSIS

### Windows

If you use the chocolatey package manager, run the following script:
```
choco install nsis
```
If you install NSIS manually, you need to add the *Bin* folder, which contains `makensis.exe`, in your NSIS installation to your path.
[Here](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/) is a good tutorial on how to add to path on Windows.

### Linux

The `nsis` package should be available through your distribution's package manager.

### MacOS

NSIS is available to install through homebrew: `brew install nsis`.

## Generating the installer

When a new project is created, Wails generates a `.nsi` installer script in `build/windows/installer`.

To generate an installer for your application, use the `-nsis` flag with `wails build`:
```
wails build -nsis
```
